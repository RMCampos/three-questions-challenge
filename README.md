## Challenge repo

This repo contains three challenges. Three questions. These challenges were
given to me on an interview process. I was able to solve only two of them
in time. But later I could solve the third first.

### 1st Challenge

Given a text string, create a method to check if the opening and closing
brackets are matching.
