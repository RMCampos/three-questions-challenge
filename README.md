## Challenge repo

This repo contains challenges and algorithms study. These challenges were
given to me on an interview process. The algorithms I decided to study
by myself.

### 1st Challenge

Given a text string, create a method to check if the opening and closing
brackets are matching.

- Signature: `boolean validBracketSequence(String sequence)`
- Implementation: [First.java](src/main/java/blog/ricardocampos/First.java)

### 2nd Challenge

Given two strings `a` and `b`, both consisting only of lowercase English letters,
calculate how many strings equal to `a` can be constructed using only letters from
the string `b`? Each letter can be used only once and in one string only.

- Signature: `int stringsConstruction(String a, String b)`
- Implementation: [Second.java](src/main/java/blog/ricardocampos/Second.java)

### 3rd Challenge

- Link: Sorry. Didn't find first.
- Signature: `double closestPointPair(int[][] p)`

### Binary Search

Given an integer array and a value, implement a function that search for that value
using a binary tree algorithm.

- Signature: `int find(int[] arr, int x)`
- Implementation: [BinarySearch.java](src/main/java/blog/ricardocampos/BinarySearch.java)
